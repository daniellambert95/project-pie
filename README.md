# Set up

**Stage one**

- Created a repository with GIT and Github so we can host our project files somewhere.
- Added a README.md file & .gitignore

**Stage two**

- Created some HTML files as well as CSS, then built a front end that would be the basis of where our project will be uploaded to. 

- Created a Github page so we have a live site that we can visit at any time and share with others

**Stage three**

Development setup

- Created a virtual environment for our project using python3

To create the virtual environment

1. ``` python3 -m venv myenv ``` This creates environment called myenv
2. ``` source myenv/bin/activate ``` This activates the environment
The environment must be activated each time when working in the command line
3. Enter the .gitignore file and add /myenv/ as this environment should not be commit and just incase it is it will now be ignored by GIT

**Stage four**

Warehouse ordering programme

- Create a script that will guide a user through ordering an item from a list of warehouse stock data

1. Programme runs on the command line interface
2. Files can be found in the folder CLI warehouse

**Stage five coming soon**
